## End of Day Summary

### Completed
✅ Mastered 18 essential Linux commands
✅ Created functional practice scripts
✅ Understood file permissions deeply
✅ Built executable demos

### Time Spent
- Command learning: 2 hours
- Permissions practice: 1.5 hours
- Script creation: 1 hour
- Total: 4.5 hours

### Challenges Faced
- Initially confused about chmod numeric vs symbolic notation
- Forgot to make scripts executable before running (learned about +x!)
- Accidentally used spaces in `chmod u+x, g+x` (should be no spaces)

### Key Insights
1. The `.` in `cd .` means current directory
2. `..` always means parent directory
3. Permissions errors are usually missing execute permission
4. `tree` is invaluable for visualizing directory structure

### Tomorrow's Plan
- Advanced commands: grep, find, pipes
- Text processing: awk, sed basics
- System exploration: /etc, /var directories
- Practice with larger files

### Questions to Research
- How do symbolic links work?
- What's the difference between hard and soft links?
- How does sudo actually work under the hood?
